         <h1 className='text-4xl font-GothamBold text-center mt-24 mb-8'>Concept and Objective</h1>
         <p className='text-xl font-GothamBook font-normal leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify'>India is an agro based country. Agricultural is an important pillar of our economy. Yet, a large number of agro waste post harvest is waste. There is a huge value hidden in this post harvest agro waste. Also the use of rdf waste and legacy waste in cement and steel industries is very inefficient.On the other hand our nation is going through coal crises. We at Hab Biomass Pvt Ltd have developed and innovative mobile unit to convert one ton of agro waste per hour into high GCV biocoal briquettes to be used as fuel in industries. Our innovation acts as a bridge between these two points. We not only supports environment but also give second income to farmer.</p>
         <h2 className='text-2xl font-GothamMedium mt-2 mb-2 tracking-normal'>Our innovation revolves around 5 major problems</h2>
          <ul className='text-xl font-GothamBook leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify list-disc ml-6 list-inside'>
            <li>Disposal of Agro waste by burning</li>
            <li>Human Intervention and less availiblity of labour in Handeling of Agro Waste.</li>
            <li>Logistics of loose agro waste, a SCM Error.</li>
            <li>Centralised Place for hoarding/storage of Waste</li>
            <li>Sustainable disposal of agro waste by create value out of waste.</li>

          </ul>
          <h2 className='text-2xl font-GothamMedium mt-2 mb-2 tracking-normal'>Problem Statement</h2>
          <ol className='text-xl font-GothamBook leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify list-inside ml-6 list-decimal'>
            
            <li>Agro waste disposal by burning, which is not only a waste of a useful resource but also causes huge pollution.</li>
            <li>Human intervention and a scarcity of labour in the handling of agricultural waste.</li>
            <li>Inefficient logistics of loose agro-waste waste: an SCM error because agro-waste volume is much greater than weight.</li>
            <li>The availability of storage and hoarding space for agricultural waste.</li>

          </ol>
         </div>

         <div className='ml-16 mr-16 lg:ml-28 lg:mr-28'>
         <h1 className='text-4xl font-GothamBold text-center mt-16 mb-8'>Business Model</h1>
         <p className='text-xl font-GothamBook leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify'>Our current business model is based on a decentralised approach, in which we will manufacture a mobile unit to convert agro waste into high gcv bio briquettes for use in furnaces and boilers for combustion.</p>
         <h2 className='text-2xl font-GothamMedium mt-2 mb-2 tracking-normal'>Our revenue is generated through three channels:</h2>
          <ul className='text-xl font-GothamBook leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify list-disc ml-6 list-inside'>
            <li>Sale of briquettes</li>
            <li>Built to operate/rental</li>
            <li>Sale of machine.</li>
            
          </ul>
          <p className='text-xl font-GothamBook leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify'>Our major savings will be in logistics of raw materials, facility space, space to hoard raw materials, space for finished goods and many more. This money saved will be directly reflected in our profit margin.</p>
         <h2 className='text-2xl font-GothamMedium mt-2 mb-2 tracking-normal'>How is the need currently addressed:</h2>
         <p className='text-xl font-GothamBook leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify'>Most of the time, the agro waste is burned. A few processes use agro waste to manufacture different commodities, but they are not efficient as the logistics and collection of agro waste is a difficult task. A lot of labour work is involved in processing this agro waste. Even the current briquetting unit is always running out of raw materials and other resources as they lack mobility and have heavy investments made in them.</p>
         <h2 className='text-2xl font-GothamMedium mt-2 mb-2 tracking-normal'>Primary Benefits:</h2>
         <p className='text-xl font-GothamBook leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify'>Farmers will be our primary beneficiaries because we will provide them with a door-to-door tool for converting their agro waste into high-GCV bio briquettes. The transparent system will not only help them earn extra money from agricultural waste, but it will also give them a sense of openness and security. Our second beneficiaries would be the farm labourers and rural youth, as we have reduced the human effort of the labour work required and thereby generated BOP employment.Businesses will benefit as well, as we will provide them with biomass briquettes for combustion in boilers and furnaces. Also, the environmental benefits will be shared by the entire ecosystem nearby; the humans, animals, and soil microbes that get affected due to the burning of this agro waste.</p>

         <p className='text-xl font-GothamBook leading-loose tracking-normal text-justify'>Age, sex, income level, race, employment, location, homeownership, and level of education While creating the customer persona with Standford Seed Spark Programme, we came across a data of 138 probable customers, across Maharashtra. With respect to that we got an ensight about the demographic profile of our customer. Our customer is primarily a 40 to 50 year old male farmer, who takes decision about major farming activities. He is located in rural part of the country. He is moderately educated between 12th standard to graduation. His annual profit is around 3 lakh to 5 lakh, with around 3 to 5 acre of land. Apart from his regular farm income, he is always in search of additional income parallel to farming. He is very emotional but at the same time fears to keep trust on new concepts. He is basically a follower and will get it immediately if the other person in his group buys it. He is loyal and personal connect and appreciation or limelight on him has deep impact on his decision making.</p>
